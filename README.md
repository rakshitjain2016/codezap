# codezap
Codezap is a website for people who have keen interest in competitive coding and want to test their coding skills. In this website, the coder will write a code in any below mentioned programming languages. To Run and Compile this code, the user will make a bet which should be greater than 0 and less than equal to his score. If the code have some bugs or is not able to pass all the testcase, in that case the user loses the point equal to the bet made.
